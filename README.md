#Natural Language Processing 

Spam Filtering Project

## About the project
Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk. Often
spam is sent via email, but it can also be distributed via text messages, phone calls, or social media.
Natural Language Processing has been very promising in detecting spam messages in recent years.
Nowadays all bid email service providers use NLP to automatically detect spam emails.
